## Problem Statement

Students across Bharat face a critical information gap when making educational and career decisions. They struggle with:

- **Fragmented Information**: Education opportunities, exam details, and career paths are scattered across multiple sources
- **Language Barriers**: Most guidance platforms operate only in English, excluding millions of regional language speakers
- **Lack of Personalization**: Generic advice doesn't consider individual academic performance, interests, or socioeconomic background
- **Limited Awareness**: Students miss scholarships, government schemes, and opportunities due to poor information dissemination
- **Accessibility Issues**: Rural and economically disadvantaged students lack access to quality career counseling

This results in poor career choices, underutilization of government education schemes, and perpetuation of educational inequality across different regions and communities.
